              youâ€™re shopping, it increases the number of clipper coins on your
              dashboard. You can keep an eye on how many coins you have earned
              on your dashboard and redeem them however you like later.
              Therefore, keep in mind that the bigger the store, the bigger the
              deal and the bigger the number of clipper coins.
